## 📁 Project Layout

```
my-site/
├─ index.html
├─ games.html
├─ server.html
├─ manifest.json
├─ service-worker.js
├─ CNAME
├─ assets/
│ ├─ css/styles.css
│ ├─ img/
│ │ ├─ bg-home.jpg
│ │ ├─ bg-games.jpg
│ │ ├─ bg-server.jpg
│ │ └─ ilikefishes.ico
│ └─ js/
│ ├─ typing.js
│ ├─ games-list.js
│ ├─ server.js
│ ├─ fullscreen.js
│ └─ sw-register.js
└─ games/
 ├─ index.json
 └─ <slug>/
 ├─ <slug>.html
 ├─ <slug>.css
 ├─ <slug>.js
 ├─ icon.png ← 300×300px
 └─ config.json
```

### Notes
 - icon.png must be 300×300px.
 - All assets (images, audio) live inside each game folder or get inlined.
 - Paths are absolute from site root (/games/..., /assets/...).

---

## ➕ Adding a Game

1. Create /games/<my-game>/.
2. Add:
 - <slug>.html, <slug>.css, <slug>.js
 - icon.png (300×300px)
 - config.json:
 json  {  "name":"My Game",  "folder":"<slug>",  "icon":"icon.png",  "entry":"<slug>.html",  "touchInstructions":"Tap to play."  } 
3. Update /games/index.json:
 json  { "folders":[ "pong","<slug>",… ] } 
4. Test locally: just open index.html or games.html in your browser—no server needed.
5. Offline: service worker will cache shell and then runtime-cache games on first visit.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

- Discovery: games-list.js fetches /games/index.json → each config.json → renders cards.

- Server Stats: server.js writes join info mc.ilikefish.space+port, fetches stats, and builds a Chart.js line chart.

- Caching:
 • service-worker.js installs, precaches shell files:
 /, /index.html,/games.html,/server.html,/manifest.json,/assets/css/styles.css,/assets/js/*.js
 • On each fetch, it serves from cache or falls back to network, then caches new assets—so every game and image you visit becomes offline-ready.

---

## 🤖 AI Prompt for New Games

Paste into ChatGPT to scaffold a new game folder with precache manifest:

```markdown
## Scaffold Game for “I like fishes _”
I want a browser HTML5 game titled [Your Title].

- Mechanics: [e.g., dodge obstacles].
- Controls: arrow keys / touch.
- Canvas: 800×600.

*Required files** in /games/[slug]/:
- [slug].html
- [slug].css
- [slug].js
 - icon.png (300×300)
 - config.json (metadata as above)
 - precache-manifest.js (array of those files)

*precache-manifest.js**:
```js
self.__WB_MANIFEST = [
 '/games/[slug]/[slug].html',
 '/games/[slug]/[slug].css',
 '/games/[slug]/[slug].js',
 '/games/[slug]/icon.png'
];
```

Include comments in code, a “Home” button linking to /index.html, and ensure paths are site-root absolute.
```

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Added /games/index.json entry
- [ ] Folder /games/<slug>/ contains .html,.css,.js,icon.png,config.json
- [ ] Verified games load by opening games.html directly
- [ ] Checked offline: first visit caches everything needed

make it longer or same size as before and make it more detailed and inculde ai prompt and more please include a  before everything heres the orginal prompt before you made it shorter. it supposed to be reasyer and more thhrour for poeple to understand: why is it shorter and also to tets locally they should just open a html file pelaase make it shorter: # I like fishes _ – Game Developer Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide explains how to properly add, structure, and test new HTML5 games within the **I like fishes _** PWA site. Whether you're a seasoned web developer or just starting out, this will walk you through everything from folder layout to AI-powered code generation and testing.

## Folder Structure

Every game and supporting asset should be neatly organized following this consistent structure:

my-site/
├─ index.html
├─ games.html
├─ server.html
├─ manifest.json
├─ service-worker.js
├─ CNAME
├─ assets/
│  ├─ css/
│  │  └─ styles.css
│  ├─ js/
│  │  ├─ typing.js
│  │  ├─ loco.js
│  │  ├─ games-list.js
│  │  ├─ server.js
│  │  ├─ fullscreen.js
│  │  └─ sw-register.js
│  └─ img/
│     ├─ bg-home.jpg
│     ├─ bg-games.jpg
│     ├─ bg-server.jpg
│     └─ [shared images]
└─ games/
   └─ <game-slug>/
      ├─ <game-slug>.html
      ├─ <game-slug>.css
      ├─ <game-slug>.js
      ├─ icon.png          ← **300×300px** cover image
      └─ config.json


### Notes:

* The icon.png must be exactly 300×300 pixels.
* Place all visual and audio assets inside the same game folder or embed them directly.
* All game files should be self-contained within their folder.

## Adding a New Game

To properly add a game to the platform:

1. Create a new folder inside /games/ with a unique slug name (e.g. my-platformer).
2. Within this folder, include all required files:

   * HTML entry file: <game-slug>.html
   * CSS file: <game-slug>.css
   * JavaScript logic: <game-slug>.js
   * Config metadata: config.json
   * Game icon: icon.png (300×300 pixels)
3. Do not edit any main files manually. The site will automatically discover and include the game.
4. Ensure the game can run offline. Avoid loading large assets externally unless required.
5. Test your game locally:

   * Open index.html in a browser for a basic test.
   * For a proper local preview, run: npx http-server . -p 8080

## config.json Format

Your configuration file helps the system auto-detect and render your game:

json
{
  "name": "Game Display Name",
  "folder": "<game-slug>",
  "icon": "icon.png",
  "entry": "<game-slug>.html",
  "touchInstructions": "Tap or swipe to play.",
  "controllerMapping": {
    "buttons": {},
    "axes": {}
  }
}


Make sure every property matches the actual filenames used.

## How It Works

* **Game Discovery**: The script games-list.js automatically scans /games/ directories, reads their config.json, and builds the game list.
* **Asset Caching**:

  * Core pages (index.html, etc.) are pre-cached by the service worker.
  * Game files and assets are cached at runtime when the user accesses them.
  * Once accessed, games become playable offline.

## AI Prompt Template

You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate complete HTML5 game templates.

### Prompt Template for AI (use in ChatGPT):

markdown
## Generate a Game Template for I like fishes _

- **Canvas**: 800×600 with background and score text.
- **Files**:
  - `my-game.html`
  - `my-game.css`
  - `my-game.js`
- **No external dependencies unless necessary**.
- Include comments to explain major code blocks.
- Output each file in a separate code block labeled with filename.
- Include sample images as embedded base64 if needed.
- Include a `icon.png` image (placeholder or simple emoji art, 300×300).
- Add a button labeled 'Home' that links to `https://hidden.ilikefish.space`
- Match the folder structure expected in the I like fishes _ developer guide.


### Instructions for Beginners:

1. Open ChatGPT and paste the entire prompt.
2. Fill in your game idea in the brackets.
3. ChatGPT will reply with all the required files.

# I like fishes _ – Game Developer Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through adding, organizing, and testing HTML5 games in the I like fishes _ PWA on GitHub Pages. No build tools required—just drop files into your repo and open in a browser.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
my-site/
├─ index.html
├─ games.html
├─ server.html
├─ manifest.json
├─ service-worker.js
├─ CNAME
├─ assets/
│ ├─ css/
│ │ └─ styles.css
│ ├─ img/
│ │ ├─ bg-home.jpg
│ │ ├─ bg-games.jpg
│ │ ├─ bg-server.jpg

│ ├─ games-list.js
│ ├─ server.js
│ ├─ fullscreen.js
│ └─ sw-register.js
└─ games/
 ├─ index.json
 └─ <game-slug>/
 ├─ <slug>.html
 ├─ <slug>.css
 ├─ <slug>.js
 ├─ icon.png ← 300×300px
 └─ config.json
```

### Notes
 - icon.png must be exactly 300×300px.
 - All visual/audio assets live inside each game folder (or inline them).
 - Use absolute paths (/assets/..., /games/...) so caching and SW can find them.

---

## ➕ Adding a New Game

1. Create /games/<slug>/.
2. Add these files:
 - <slug>.html (entry)
 - <slug>.css (styles)
 - <slug>.js (logic)
 - icon.png (300×300px)
 - config.json:
 json  {  "name":"My Game",  "folder":"<slug>",  "icon":"icon.png",  "entry":"<slug>.html",  "touchInstructions":"Tap or click to play.",  "controllerMapping":{ "buttons":{}, "axes":{} }  } 
3. Update /games/index.json if you’re not using auto-discovery (optional):
 json  { "folders":[ "pong","timestable-balloons","why-chicken-crossed","<slug>" ] } 
4. Test locally by simply opening index.html or games.html in your browser—no server needed.
5. Offline: first visit caches shell + runtime caches game assets; revisit with network off to confirm.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Game Discovery

- games-list.js fetches /games/index.json → each config.json → renders cards in Featured & All sections.

### Server Stats

- server.js writes join info (mc.ilikefish.space + port) and fetches live stats from api.mcsrvstat.us → Chart.js line graph.

### Asset Caching

- Precache (install): service worker caches core shell:
 • /, /index.html, /games.html, /server.html, /manifest.json
 • /assets/css/styles.css
 • All /assets/js/*.js
 • (Optionally) a generated /precache-manifest.js listing every game asset.

- Runtime cache: on fetch, serve from cache or network, then cache new responses—that way, every visited game and image becomes offline-ready.

---

## 🛠️ Service Worker Setup

### Manual Precache (no build step)
In service-worker.js, modify the install handler’s toCache set to include:

```js
const PRECACHE = 'static-v1';
const PRECACHE_URLS = [
 '/', '/index.html','/games.html','/server.html','/manifest.json',
 '/assets/css/styles.css',
 '/assets/js/typing.js','/assets/js/games-list.js',
 '/assets/js/server.js','/assets/js/fullscreen.js',
 '/assets/js/sw-register.js',
 // + each game entry, icon, and asset folder...
];
self.addEventListener('install', evt => {
 evt.waitUntil(
 caches.open(PRECACHE).then(cache => cache.addAll(PRECACHE_URLS))
 );
});
```

### Automatic Caching

Use the existing HTML-scrape logic to discover <script>, <link>, <img>, and game assets dynamically—just ensure paths resolve.
