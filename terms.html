    <p class="muted">Effective date: August 1, 2025 — Last updated: August 2025</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using <strong>ilikefish.space</strong> (the "Site"), you agree to these Terms & Conditions (the "Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. About the Site</h2>
      <p>The Site provides browser-based mini-games and related resources. Content is provided under the <a href="https://unlicense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unlicense</a> unless otherwise noted. Third-party games are contributed by authors and remain the responsibility of their creators.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>When using the Site you must not:</p>
      <ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Accounts & Local Data</h2>
      <p>The Site does not require a user account. Game progress and preferences are typically stored locally in your browser (localStorage and/or IndexedDB). You are encouraged to export important data using the Site's export feature — the Site is not responsible for loss of local data.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Cookies, Analytics & Advertising</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies. We only load analytics or advertising scripts after you give consent via the cookie consent dialog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Necessary cookies:</strong> required for site functionality and cannot be disabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> optional; collects anonymous usage data (e.g., Google Analytics) if you consent; IP anonymization is enabled where supported.</li>
        <li><strong>Ads:</strong> optional; ad networks may serve non-personalized ads by default; personalized ads require additional consent and may rely on third-party cookies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may change your cookie preferences using the "Cookie settings" link in the site footer. For more detail, see the cookie banner and the privacy notice on the Site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Site may link to or embed third-party services (ad networks, analytics, game engines). We are not responsible for third-party content, privacy practices, or availability. Third parties may collect data under their own policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">

      <p>The Site is provided "as-is" and "as-available". To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Site and its maintainers disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

      <h2>12. Privacy & Your Rights</h2>
      <p>We aim to minimize data collection. If analytics or ads are enabled by you, third-party vendors may collect some data.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>13. Retention & Security</h2>
      <p>We retain minimal server-side logs for maintenance. Local data is stored in your browser — export it if you want persistence across devices. While we employ reasonable security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
