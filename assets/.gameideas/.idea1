Great — since ilikefish.space is a quirky, open-ended name, you can get creative with the theme or completely ignore it. Here’s a unique game idea that plays with the fun/weird vibe of the name, but could stand on its own:

🎮 Game Title: “Fishcore: Data Dive”
🐟 Genre:

Arcade / Endless Swimmer / Datapunk

📖 Concept:

You're a sentient fish AI escaping from a corrupted underwater data server (a.k.a. the "FishCore"). As the fish, you swim endlessly through a digital-ocean-like stream, dodging firewalls, collecting "data-packets," and upgrading your neural fins.

🎮 Gameplay:

Endless Swimmer: Similar to Jetpack Joyride or Subway Surfers, you swim through an endless side-scrolling environment.

Enemies: Corrupted fish-bots, floating malware, data piranhas.

Pickups: RAM chips, firewall bypass tokens, encryption keys.

Power-ups:

VPN Cloak: Makes you invisible to enemies temporarily.

DDoS Surge: Temporarily slows time and clears enemies.

Quantum Leap: Warp forward past a difficult section.

🧠 Mechanics:

Combo System: Chaining data pickups boosts your score multiplier.

Upgrades:

Faster swimming (processing speed),

Bigger data cache (more pickups),

Auto-defrag shield (protects from one hit).

🌐 Why it fits ilikefish.space:

Fun, quirky fish tie-in? ✅

Abstract/spacey/digital environment? ✅

Fits in a game hub that doesn’t take itself too seriously? ✅

Optional Twists:

Multiplayer leaderboard: Compete with other “escaped fish AIs.”

Retro mode: Pixel art fish with chiptune music.

Random name generator: Every fish has a weirdly generated username (e.g., “PacketPuffer77”).

Want a completely different style (like puzzle, horror, or platformer), or something more literal like fishing in space? I can give more!
